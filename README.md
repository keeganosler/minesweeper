This is a simple minesweeper game created as a web app with React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The primary focus of this project is to delve deeper into React components and JS as well as to learn Git.

Click the squares to play the game.  While in play, the app looks like this:
