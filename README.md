This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple minesweeper game created following [this] tutorial by Sandip Shrestha(https://codeburst.io/learning-react-js-by-building-a-minesweeper-game-ced9d41560ed).

The primary focus of this project is to delve deeper into React components and JS as well as to learn Git.
